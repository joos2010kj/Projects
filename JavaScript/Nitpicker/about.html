        <h1><u>About Nitpicker</u></h1>
        <p>
            Nitpicker is an application that regularly performs the job of checking 
            the availability of UMD courses for the client.
            <br /><br />

            If you are unsure if Nitpicker is right for you, see if you fall under any of the following cases
            because these all require the regular checking of open seats as whoever finds the open seat first is the "winner":
            <br />

            <ol>
                <li>You changed the upper level course permission, but the course you got a permission for does not have an open seat.</li>
                <li>Department placed a “cap” on the course, and the course has no open seat, nor can you be on the waitlist for the course.</li>
                <li>You are considering taking a course, but you cannot be on the waitlist because of credit limits.</li>
            </ol>
            
            How to use the service: <br />
            <ol>
                <li>Go to <a href="http://nitpickers.unaux.com">https://go.umd.edu/nitpicker</a>.</li>
                <li>Sign up with an email you want to be notified with (every user's information is strongly encrypted through hash).</li>
                <li>Verify your e-mail.</li>
                <li>Enter the information of the course you would like checked and hit submit. The detailed instruction will be written in the bottom of the page as well.</li>
                <li>Just wait! You will be informed over the email (nitpicker.umd@gmail.com) if Nitpicker finds out that there is an open seat for the course.</li>
            </ol>

            For example, if you set an alarm for CMSC424 Section 0101 (which has 24 waitlists at the moment), 
            then it will not do anything until the waitlist goes down to 0 and an open seat is found, 
            at which it will send a notification email to you. This way, you will not have to bother 
            checking the open seat every day since Nitpicker will do the job for you regularly!
            <br /><br />

            NOTE: It is called Nitpicker because it will keep notifying you if it finds an open seat 
            every so often until you tell it to stop on the website. How to command it to stop is shown in the website.
            <br /><br />

            Please let me know through email (nitpicker.umd@gmail.com) if you are 
            experiencing any issues with it.
            <br /><br />
