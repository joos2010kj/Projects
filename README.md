# Projects

This repo has a collection of projects I have made.

Projects will be initially separated by the language it was made in -- Java & JavaScript.

Each project in this repo will have a "Screen Shot" folder where one or two screenshot(s) of the program will be stored.

If you are interested, please feel free to try them yourself by downloading the program!

### JAVA
1. [Tutor-Client Schedule Builder](https://github.com/joos2010kj/Projects/tree/master/Java/Schedule%20Overlapper)
    - Tutor-Client Schedule Builder helps to find an ideal time for an event. This may also be used between a tutor and a client to determine an ideal session time by, first, having both of them select all the available times in a week using the program, and, next, having the program find and list the overlapping time frames in order of the usersâ€™ preference. It has several features for convenience, including Jumping-by-Hour feature, Interval feature, and Saving feature.

### JAVASCRIPT
1. [Automatic Racecar](https://github.com/joos2010kj/Projects/tree/master/JavaScript/VISION/Automatic%20Racecar)
    - Automatic Racecar is a project I worked on to make a bot that dodges all the incoming obstacles by itself.  The bot moves in a straight line when there is no obstacle within the sight, and when there is any obstacle, its color will change from green to blue and react accordingly. You can adjust the bot's angle of vision (default angle: 100 degrees) and sight distance (default sight distance: 100px) to see a varying outcome. This is part of VISION Project.

2. [Follower](https://github.com/joos2010kj/Projects/tree/master/JavaScript/VISION/Follower)
    - Follower has a character inside that continues to follow the cursor of the client and changes its color when the cursor is within its angle of vision. This is part of VISION Project.
